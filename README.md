Hello!

I'm a Software Engineer @ [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/) working on [Portworx](https://www.portworx.com). I'm the tech lead for the Portworx CSI Driver and I also work on control plane components such as the SDK, Security features, and more! I'm also a core contributer to [Kubernetes-CSI](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi) and k8s SIG-Storage!

When I'm not coding, you can find me in the mountains climbing rock, ice, and snow!
